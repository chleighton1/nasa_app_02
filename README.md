React App using NASA API and Google OAuth

Welcome to my NASA API app using Nodejs for the backend, React for the frontend and MongoDB for the database.

The app is very simple. You can either sign-in or sign-up via the app or you can use Google 0Auth to sign in.

Once you are signed in you will be taken to the home page which fetches data from the NASA API and displays the current picture of the day with a corrosponding title and description.
